# Echo Journal - Frontend

Echo Journal is a journaling app designed to make reflection motivating, rewarding, and insightful.
Inspired by BeReal, it introduces an unlock system: each time you write, you unlock an anonymous entry from someone else in the world.

Combined with AI-powered insights,
it transforms scattered notes into an organized memory system of moods, intentions, and life themes.

This repo contains the React + Tailwind CSS frontend of the project.

The [backend repo](https://github.com/Endellos/echo_journal) is built with FastAPI.
